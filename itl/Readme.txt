Interval Template Library (ITL) Version 1.0.0

1. Overview

The ITL is a collection of generic c++ template classes for computations
dealing with 'collections of intervals'. The most important instance of their
use is the computation with containers of time intervals that are associated to
values. We call such containers histories and their elements episodes. In
addition to intervals and interval containers the library contains classes for
generalized crosstables, which are tupel containers. We call such containers
'tupel computers' or 'cubes'.

2. Licence

The ITL is open source under the Boost Software License - Version 1.0

3. Installation

ITL 1.0.0 comes as zip-file. Unzip to a directory <itl-location> of your
choice. To use the ITL add <itl-location> to your include path. The included
vc++ sample projects <itl-location>/itl/sample/samples/samples.sln and test
projects <itl-location>/itl/sample/test/tests/tests.sln are supposed to compile
and run with vc++ 8.x

4. Portability

Portability is not yet tested for compilers other than vc6.0 - vc8.x. Checking
portability for gnu gcc will be done soon.

5. Documentation:

The source code comes with a html-documentation generated with doxygen:
<itl-location>/itl/doc/html/index.html. Further information can be found there.
